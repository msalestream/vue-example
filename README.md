#### Vue.js Example
The development team has been talking about using a frontend framework. 
I wrote this example to showcase the easy of use when working with Vue and Requirejs. The example currently doesn't use any
routes although the router is included. Notice the modularity promoted by Vue's component system, and the cleanliness of the code.

##### Things to do:
1. Write require.js optimizer
2. Showcase routes
